TASK 2: Project Title: Movie Recommendation System  Project Description: Build a basic movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history or preferences. This project will introduce you to the concepts of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation.
Movie Recommendation System Documentation
Introduction The Movie Recommendation System is a project aimed at building a personalized movie recommendation engine. Its primary goal is to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The scope of this system encompasses data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, recommendation algorithms, user interfaces, and evaluation.

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Data Source The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. The primary files include:

movies_metadata.csv: Contains movie details such as title, genre, director, and actors. ratings_small.csv: Contains user ratings for various movies. Data Description movies_metadata.csv: This dataset consists of 45,000+ records, with information on over 20 features per movie, including genre, production companies, release date, and more. ratings_small.csv: This dataset includes 100,000+ user ratings for different movies. Each entry includes a user ID, movie ID, and rating. Preprocessing Data from both CSV files was loaded and merged to create a unified dataset. Null values were handled, and columns with excessive missing data were dropped. Date fields were converted to a standardized format. Genres and keywords were one-hot encoded for content-based filtering. Duplicate records were removed, and outliers were addressed. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) The EDA phase revealed several insights:

Distribution of movie ratings: The majority of ratings fall between 3 and 4.

Most popular genres:

Drama, Comedy, and Thriller are the most common genres.

User preferences:

Some users consistently rate movies highly, while others provide more varied ratings.

Recommendation Algorithms

Collaborative Filtering Collaborative filtering is implemented using a user-based approach. It identifies users similar to the target user and recommends movies liked by those similar users. Metrics like RMSE and MAE are used for evaluation.

Content-Based Filtering Content-based filtering suggests movies similar to those the user has already liked. Features like genre, director, and actors are utilized.

Hybrid Recommendation The hybrid recommendation engine combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide diverse and accurate movie suggestions.

User Interface (Basic CLI Interface) The command-line interface (CLI) allows users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations. It includes options for getting recommendations and exiting the system.

Evaluation Evaluation metrics include RMSE and MAE for collaborative filtering. Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated for content-based filtering. User feedback and A/B testing also contribute to evaluation.

Testing The system is tested by real users who provide feedback on the recommendations. Automated testing scripts simulate user interactions to identify issues and regressions.

Conclusion The Movie Recommendation System aims to provide users with personalized and relevant movie suggestions. It's an ongoing project, and user feedback and testing will be instrumental in refining the system further.
